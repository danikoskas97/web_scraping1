## Web scraping first project üöÄ

you just need to uncomment only the code to delete urls.txt and run in the IDE or Terminal.
i use pycharm so the .txt will be created in the folder that you work on it.
after you run please comment this:

```python
with open('urls.txt', 'w') as file:
    for link in links:
        file.write(link + "\n")
```
after this you can now store all the data in .csv file and run this:
```py
with open('urls.txt', 'r') as inf:
    with open('pays.csv', 'w') as outf:
        outf.write('pays, \t\t\t\t population\n')
        for row in inf:
            url = row.strip()
            response = requests.get(url)
            if response.ok:
                soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml')
                country = soup.find('tr', {'id': 'places_country__row'}).find('td', {'class': 'w2p_fw'})
                pop = soup.find('tr', {'id': 'places_population__row'}).find('td', {'class': 'w2p_fw'})
                print('Pays: ' + country.text + ' Pop: ' + pop.text)
                outf.write(country.text + ',' + '\t' + '\t' + '\t' + pop.text.replace(',', '') + '\n')
            time.sleep(1)
```
