# web_scraping1
## Web scraping first project 🚀

you just need to uncomment all and run in the IDE or Terminal.
i use pycharm so the .txt will be created in the folder that you work on it.
after you run please comment:

```python
with open('urls.txt', 'w') as file:
    for link in links:
        file.write(link + "\n")
```
